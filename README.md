## How to use OBS Service `cargo vendor`

Typical Rust projects may have a **workspace** manifest at the **root of their project directory**. Others don't and do not really require much intervention.

A good example would be the [zellij](https://zellij.dev) project. Users will just depend the first Cargo.toml found in that project. Therefore, they do not need to use the 
`cargotoml` parameter for the `_service` file.

```xml
<services>
  <service name="download_files" mode="manual" />
  <service name="cargo_vendor" mode="manual">
     <param name="src">zellij-0.37.2.tar.gz</param>
     <param name="compression">zst</param>
     <param name="update">true</param>
  </service>
  <service name="cargo_audit" mode="manual" />
</services>
```
## Versioned Dirs

The `--versioned-dirs` flag is used when you
- want to know the version quickly
- prefer this configuration

By default, it is set to true. So far, it has no impact on how we vendor.

## Accepting risks of RUSTSEC advisories

Sometimes, software dependencies have vulnerabilities or security issues, and it's not that surprising. If you just want to YOLO because this version
should now be in openSUSE, you can "accept a risk" of a RUSTSEC ID by adding a new parameter `i-accept-the-risk`:

```xml
<services>
  <service mode="manual" name="download_files" />
  <service name="cargo_vendor" mode="manual">
     <param name="srctar">atuin-*.tar.gz</param>
	 <param name="i-accept-the-risk">RUSTSEC-2022-0093</param>
	 <param name="i-accept-the-risk">RUSTSEC-2021-0041</param>
  </service>
  <service name="cargo_audit" mode="manual" />
</services>
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you are not sure what to do, let a security expert assess and audit it for you by just pushing the new update.

## Using `cargotoml` parameter

Use only `cargotoml` in situations where you need to also vendor a subcrate. This is useful for certain projects with no root manifest like the warning below.

When adding a `cargotoml` parameter, make sure *it is after the root folder*. For example, your project has a root folder named `s390-tools`, and then you should
omit `s390-tools` and proceed to the files or subfolders next to it. So a manifest file located at `s390-tools/rust/utils/Cargo.toml` will have
the following `cargotoml` parameter value of `rust/utils/Cargo.toml`.

> [!WARNING]
> Certain projects may not have a root manifest file, thus, each directory may be a separate subproject e.g. https://github.com/ibm-s390-linux/s390-tools 
> and may need some thinking.
> 
> ```xml
> <services>
>   <service name="cargo_vendor" mode="manual">
>      <param name="srcdir">s390-tools</param>
>      <param name="compression">zst</param>
>      <param name="cargotoml">rust/utils/Cargo.toml</param>
>      <param name="update">true</param>
>   </service>
>   <service name="cargo_audit" mode="manual" />
> </services>
> ```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If a project uses a workspace, you don't actually need to do this unless the workspace manifest is part of a subproject.

Once you are ready, run the following command locally:

```bash
osc service mr
```

Then add the generated tarball of vendored dependencies:

```bash
osc add vendor.tar.zst
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Some Rust software such as the infamous https://github.com/elliot40404/bonk do not have any dependencies so they may not generate a vendored tarball.
> The service will give you an output of information about it by checking the manifest file.

# What is inside `vendor.tar.<zst,gz,xz>`?

The files inside the vendored tarball contains the following:
- a lockfile `Cargo.lock`. Sometimes it does not exist if the project directory is super different e.g. flux
- other lockfiles and their respective directories. See more [here](#about-lockfiles)
- a `.cargo/config`
- the crates that were fetched during the vendor process.

When extracted, it will have the following paths when extracted.

```
.
├── .cargo/
│   └── config
├── Cargo.lock
├──.<Path to other Cargo.locks in their respective subcrates/subprojects>
└── vendor/
```

This means, a `%prep` section may look like this

```
%prep
%autosetup -a1
```

No need to copy a `cargo_config` or a lockfile to somewhere else or add it as part of the sources in the specfile. *They are all part of the vendored tarball now*.

> [!NOTE]
> If desired, you may use this knowledge for weird projects that have weird build configurations. 

# About lockfiles

OBS Cargo Vendor does a boring way to check for lockfiles:

1. If a manifest is not a workspace manifest, it's likely the lockfile
is in the directory of where the manifest is
2. If a manifest is part or a member of a workspace manifest, then it's
likely that the lockfile is on the path of where the workspace manifest
is.

So we just eagerly take all manifest paths from the parameters, and
just check if there are any lockfiles there. And then we slap their full
paths to be part of the vendored tarball. So a path that looks like
`rust/pv/Cargo.lock` may also be reflected in the vendored tarball. Thus,
if extracted, it will go to the desired path `rust/pv/Cargo.lock` from
the root folder of the project.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If a source does not ship a lockfile, we attempt to regenerate it by
> running the command
> ```bash
> cargo generate-lockfile
> ```
> This ensures that there will be no errors during a `cargo update` or
> a build when update is set to false but there was no lockfile originally.
> Therefore, we check if there is a lockfile **twice**.

## Respecting lockfiles

A new option is added to respect lockfiles. This means that vendored tarballs
are expected to have the same metadata inside the `Cargo.lock`.

> [!WARNING]
> `cargo-vendor-filterer` is not supported for lockfile validation/verification


# How to do multiple vendors

It is possible to do multiple vendored tarballs by using the `--tag` parameter. This allows you to rename your vendored
in various contexts e.g. projects that are not part of one whole workspace. Example:

```xml
<services>
  <service name="cargo_vendor" mode="manual">
        <param name="src">s390-tools-2.29.0.tar.gz</param>
        <!-- omit root directory name -->
        <param name="cargotoml">rust/pv/Cargo.toml</param>
        <param name="i-accept-the-risk">RUSTSEC-2023-0044</param>
        <param name="tag">rust-pv</param>
        <param name="update">true</param>
  </service>
  <service name="cargo_vendor" mode="manual">
        <!-- omit root directory name -->
        <param name="src">s390-tools-2.29.0.tar.gz</param>
        <param name="cargotoml">rust/pvsecret/Cargo.toml</param>
        <param name="i-accept-the-risk">RUSTSEC-2023-0044</param>
        <param name="tag">pvsecret</param>
        <param name="update">true</param>
  </service>
  <service name="cargo_vendor" mode="manual">
        <!-- omit root directory name -->
        <param name="src">s390-tools-2.29.0.tar.gz</param>
        <param name="cargotoml">rust/utils/Cargo.toml</param>
        <param name="i-accept-the-risk">RUSTSEC-2023-0044</param>
        <param name="tag">utils</param>
        <param name="update">true</param>
  </service>
  <service name="cargo_audit" mode="manual" />
</services>
```

This will produce the following tarballs:

- `vendor-rust-pv.tar.zst`
- `vendor-pvsecret.tar.zst`
- `vendor-utils.tar.zst`

Thus, this allows you to have many vendored tarballs by using the `--tag` parameter.

> [!WARNING]
> As long as the manifest file contains dependencies or the manifest file is a workspace
> it will produce a vendored tarball. Otherwise, although it is *somewhat* correct to
> say `vendor-utils.tar.zst` should be the produced tarball, in reality, it won't exist
> because it has [NO dependencies](https://github.com/ibm-s390-linux/s390-tools/blob/master/rust/utils/Cargo.toml) after all.

# List of possible scenarios when vendoring fails

- `cargo` issues. Sometimes deleting `~/.cargo` will solve your issues.
- Wrong permissions. You may not have a permission to access a file or folder.
- There are updates of this project. Please call us out on that 🤣

# Other utilities

- Bulk Updater (WIP). Allows you to update Rust software packages locally.

# Limitations

There may be some corner/edge (whatever-you-call-it) cases that will not work with **OBS Service Cargo**. Please open a bug 
report at https://github.com/openSUSE/obs-service-cargo_vendor/issues. We will try to investigate those in the best of our abilities. The goal of this
project is to help automate some tasks when packaging Rust software. We won't assume we can automate where we can a locate a project's root manifest file `Cargo.toml`.
Thus, at best, please indicate it with `cargotoml` parameter. In the mean time, this will work, *hopefully*, in most projects since most projects have
a root manifest file.

## Reproducibility

This project does not and will not support reproducible builds as a feature. If you submit a PR to enable those features, we may accept it but we will not maintain or guarantee that it will continue to work in the future.
